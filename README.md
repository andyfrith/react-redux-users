# react-redux-users

A React Redux application that provides simple user management tasks

Features:
* Displays a list of users using JSX
* Can add and remove users
* Can update existing user information (first name, last name, address)
* Has a basic UI (something more than unformatted text on a screen)

## Why Did I Build This?

This app was built to demonstrate an understanding of:
* How to use Reactâ€™s state and props
* The React Redux lifecycles
* ES6 Javascript

## Environment

This project template was built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), which provides a simple way to start React projects with no build configuration needed.
